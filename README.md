## Installation
 - Install this Blender plugin if you don't have it already: [mmd_tools](https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools/archive/dev_test.zip)

 - Download the plugin: [Cats Blender Plugin](https://github.com/michaeldegroot/cats-blender-plugin/archive/master.zip)

 - Install the the addon in blender like so:

## Model
![](https://i.imgur.com/gw66CMj.png)

A vastly improved combination of Neitri and Shotariya's blender plugins, it tries to fix and optimize the armature with one click.

##### Fix model
Fixes your model automatically by:
 - Reparenting bones
 - Removing unnecessary bones
 - Renaming and translating objects and bones
 - Mixing weight paints
 - Rotating the hips
 - Joining meshes
 - Removing rigidbodies, joints and bone groups
 - Removing bone constraints
 - Deleting unused vertex groups
 - Using the correct shading

##### Delete zero weight bones
Cleans up the bones hierarchy, because MMD models usually come with a lot of extra bones that don't directly affect any vertices.

##### Import model
Imports a mmd model (.pmx, .pmd). This requires mmd_tools in order to work.

##### Separate by material
Separatres a mesh by materials

##### Join meshes
Joins all meshes into one

##### Mix weights
Deletes the selected bones and adds their weight to their respective parents.


## Translation

![](https://i.imgur.com/SCyhVn1.png)

**Can translate certain entities from any language to english** Works by sending a request to the Google translate service. This feature can be slow for entities with a large amount of items.


## Decimation

![](https://i.imgur.com/DOjZR8G.png)

**Decimate your model automatically**

##### Save Decimation
This will only decimate meshes with no shape keys.

##### Half Decimation
This will only decimate meshes with less than 4 shape keys as those are often not used.

##### Full Decimation
This will decimate your whole model deleting all shape keys in the process.


## Eye tracking
![](https://i.imgur.com/yw8INDO.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/VHw73zM.png)

**Eye tracking is used to artificially track someone when they come close to you**
It's a good idea to check the eye movement in pose mode after this operation to check the validity of the automatic eye tracking creation.

### Properties

##### Mesh
The mesh with the eyes vertex groups

##### Head
Head bone name

##### Left eye
Eye bone left name

##### Right eye
Eye bone right name

##### Blink left
The name of the shape key that controls wink left

##### Blink right
The name of the shape key that controls wink right

##### Lowerlid left
The name of the shape key that controls lowerlid left

##### Lowerlid right
The name of the shape key that controls lowerlid right

##### Disable Eye Blinking
Disables eye blinking. Useful if you only want eye movement.

##### Disable Eye Movement
Disables eye movement. Useful if you only want blinking. **IMPORTANT:** Do your decimation first if you check this!

##### Eye Movement Speed
Configure eye movement speed


## Mouth visemes
![](https://i.imgur.com/z6imAYn.png)

**Mouth visemes are used to show more realistic mouth movement in-game when talking over the microphone**
The script generates 15 shape keys from the 3 shape keys you specified. It uses the mouth visemes A, OH and CH to generate this output.
*This is still an experimental feature and will be fine tuned over the course of time*

### Properties

##### Mesh
The mesh with the mouth shape keys

##### Viseme AA
Shape key containing mouth movement that looks like someone is saying "aa"

##### Viseme OH
Shape key containing mouth movement that looks like someone is saying "oh"

##### Viseme CH
Shape key containing mouth movement that looks like someone is saying "ch". Opened lips and clenched teeth

##### Shape key mix intensity
Controls the strength in the creation of the shape keys. Lower for less mouth movement strength.


## Bone parenting

![](https://i.imgur.com/mgadT4R.png)

**Useful for Dynamic Bones where it is ideal to have one root bone full of child bones**
This works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then press 'Parent bones' and the child bones will be parented to a new bone named RootBone_xyz

##### To parent
This is a list of bones that look like they could be parented together to a root bone. Select a group of bones from the list and press "Parent bones"

##### Refresh list
This will clear the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model

##### Parent bones
This will start the parent process


## Texture atlas
![](https://i.imgur.com/qiD9jAA.png)

**Texture atlas is the process of combining multiple textures into one to save processing power to render one's model**
If you are unsure about what to do with the margin and angle setting, then leave it default. The most important setting here is texture size and target mesh.

### Properties

##### Margin
Margin to reduce bleed of adjacent islands

##### Angle
Lower for more projection groups, higher for less distortion

##### Texture size
Lower for faster bake time, higher for more detail.

##### Area Weight
Weight projections vector by faces with larger areas

##### Target mesh
The mesh that you want to create an atlas from

##### One Texture Material
Texture baking and multiple textures per material can look weird in the end result. Check this box if you are experiencing this.
**If any experienced blender user can tell me how to fix this more elegantly please do let me know!**


## Bone merging

![](https://i.imgur.com/S88JLJd.png)

**Lets you reduce overall bone count in a group set of bones**
This works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then set a percentage value how much bones you would like to merge together in itself and press 'Merge bones'

##### To merge
This is a list of bones that look like they could be merged together. Select a group of bones from the list and press "Merge bones"

##### Refresh list
This will clear the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model

##### Merge bones
This will start the merge process


## Update Plugin
There is an auto updater in the plugin so you don't have to keep checking for new version. This is how to check for updates:
