## Model
![](https://i.imgur.com/d1yhtHp.png)

This tries to completely fix your model with one click.

##### Import model
Imports a model with the selected type.

##### Fix model
Fixes your model automatically by:
 - Reparenting bones
 - Removing unnecessary bones
 - Renaming and translating objects and bones
 - Mixing weight paints
 - Rotating the hips
 - Joining meshes
 - Removing rigidbodies, joints and bone groups
 - Removing bone constraints
 - Deleting unused vertex groups
 - Using the correct shading
 - Making it compatible with Full Body Tracking

##### Separate by material / loose parts
Separates a mesh by materials or loose parts

##### Join meshes
Joins all meshes into one

##### Mix weights
Deletes the selected bones and adds their weight to their respective parents.

##### Start Pose Mode
Lets you test how bones will move.

##### Pose to Shape Key
Saves your current pose as a new shape key.


## Translation

![](https://i.imgur.com/SCyhVn1.png)

**Can translate certain entities from any language to english** Works by sending a request to the Google translate service. This feature can be slow for entities with a large amount of items.


## Decimation

![](https://i.imgur.com/vozxKy9.png)

**Decimate your model automatically**

##### Save Decimation
This will only decimate meshes with no shape keys.

##### Half Decimation
This will only decimate meshes with less than 4 shape keys as those are often not used.

##### Full Decimation
This will decimate your whole model deleting all shape keys in the process.

##### Custom Decimation
This will let you choose which meshes and shape keys should not be decimated.


## Eye tracking
![](https://i.imgur.com/yw8INDO.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/VHw73zM.png)

**Eye tracking is used to artificially track someone when they come close to you**
It's a good idea to check the eye movement in pose mode after this operation to check the validity of the automatic eye tracking creation.

##### Disable Eye Blinking
Disables eye blinking. Useful if you only want eye movement.

##### Disable Eye Movement
Disables eye movement. Useful if you only want blinking. **IMPORTANT:** Do your decimation first if you check this!

##### Eye Movement Speed
Configure eye movement speed


## Mouth visemes
![](https://i.imgur.com/z6imAYn.png)

**Mouth visemes are used to show more realistic mouth movement in-game when talking over the microphone**
The script generates 15 shape keys from the 3 shape keys you specified. It uses the mouth visemes A, OH and CH to generate this output.
*This is still an experimental feature and will be fine tuned over the course of time*


## Bone parenting

![](https://i.imgur.com/mgadT4R.png)

**Useful for Dynamic Bones where it is ideal to have one root bone full of child bones**
This works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then press 'Parent bones' and the child bones will be parented to a new bone named RootBone_xyz

##### To parent
This is a list of bones that look like they could be parented together to a root bone. Select a group of bones from the list and press "Parent bones"

##### Refresh list
This will clear the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model

##### Parent bones
This will start the parent process


## Texture atlas
![](https://i.imgur.com/qiD9jAA.png)

**Texture atlas is the process of combining multiple textures into one to save processing power to render one's model**
If you are unsure about what to do with the margin and angle setting, then leave it default. The most important setting here is texture size and target mesh.

### Properties

##### Margin
Margin to reduce bleed of adjacent islands

##### Angle
Lower for more projection groups, higher for less distortion

##### Texture size
Lower for faster bake time, higher for more detail.

##### Area Weight
Weight projections vector by faces with larger areas

##### Target mesh
The mesh that you want to create an atlas from

##### One Texture Material
Texture baking and multiple textures per material can look weird in the end result. Check this box if you are experiencing this.
**If any experienced blender user can tell me how to fix this more elegantly please do let me know!**


## Bone merging

![](https://i.imgur.com/FXwOvho.png)

**Lets you reduce overall bone count in a group set of bones**
This works by checking all bones and trying to figure out if they can be grouped together, which will appear in a list for you to choose from. After satisfied with the selection of this group you can then set a percentage value how much bones you would like to merge together in itself and press 'Merge bones'

##### Refresh list
This will clear the group bones list cache and rebuild it, useful if bones have changed or your model

##### Merge bones
This will start the merge process

## Copy Protection

![](https://i.imgur.com/3yxkxuy.png)

**Can protect your avatars from being ripped from the game cache**
Game cache rips in most common cases do not include blendshapes and shaders. 
This method will make it much harder for people that try to steal your avatar through ripping from cache.

#### Options:
##### Full Randomization
This will randomize every vertex of your model and it will be completely unusable for thieves.
However this method might cause problems with the Outline option from Cubed shader.
If you have any problems ingame with this option try again with option "Partial".

##### Partial Randomization
Use this if you experience issues ingame with the Full option!
This will only randomize a number of vertices and therefore will have a few unprotected areas,
but it's still unusable to thieves as a whole.
This method however reduces the glitches that can occur ingame by a lot.
Use this if you experience any issues ingame with the Full option!

#### How to setup:

1. Do all the modifications to your model in Blender before you follow the next steps!
   This option should be the last one you do in Blender before exporting!
2. You won't be able to see the mesh of your model inside the Unity bone mapping screen (it will be garbled mess, but only in there).
   Because of that, if you need to actually see your models mesh (e.g. for straightening the fingers for VR), follow the extra steps below.
   If you don't need to see the mesh (e.g. for unassigning the jaw bone) skip to step 2.
     - Export your model from Blender without enabling the protection
     - Load it up in Unity and configure it in the bone mapping screen and press "Done"
     - In Blender: Click the "Enable Protection" button and export your model
     - Then, except for just dragging the fbx into Unity, you need to go into the folder where this Unity project is located
       and then replace the unprotected fbx with the protected one. 
       That way your configurations will be kept.
     - Skip to step 4
3. In Blender: Click the "Enable Protection" button and export your model and import it into Unity
4. In Unity: Set the value of the blendshape 'Basis Original' to 100 like so: 
   https://i.imgur.com/RlrGTvV.gif
5. Because (for some odd reason) the protection increases your bounding box it could be too big to upload your model.
   If the VRCSDK complains about your model being too large, edit your bounding box back to normal here:
   (this option is below the blendshape list from above)
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/4NrfVOr.png)
6. Your avatar now behaves just like a normal one.

People that try to steal your avatar will then only see a box of mangled waifu trash instead of your original character.

##### Things to note:

- Unity can show some lighting bugs on the model. This is mostly not a problem as it will look normal inside VRChat.
- This protection method can have a negative effect on the Outline option from the Cubed shader depending
  on which randomization option you choose in Cats.
  Try it for yourself to see if it effects you and disable the option if necessary.
- The preview avatar within the avatar selection menu can look weird.
  This does not effect how it actually looks ingame.


## Update Plugin
There is an auto updater in the plugin so you don't have to keep checking for a new version.
